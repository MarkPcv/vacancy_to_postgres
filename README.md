# Project «Vacancy Database Storage»

## Description
This project allows user to create Database via PostgreSQL with tables: **Employers** 
and **Vacancies**. The information about employers and vacancies is gathered
using **HeadHunter** API platform which is commonly used in CIS region. User 
selects employers and their vacancies are stored in the user-defined database.
Then user is given a list of commands through which information from the 
database can be retrieved.

The search criteria are the following:

- Search only includes employers and their vacancies in _Russian Federation_
- Employer without open vacancies are not displayed
- Only **company-type** employers are displayed
- Vacancies without salary are ignored and only _minimum_ salary is taken into 
account and displayed to user. _Maximum_ salary is shown if minimum is omitted.
- If vacancy's salary is not given in rubles (RUB), its salary will be 
converted to RUB using exchange rate provided by API.
